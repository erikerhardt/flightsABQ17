# flightsABQ17

This package contains information about all flights that departed from ABQ
in 2017 (through November): 17,460 flights in total. To help understand
what causes delays, it also includes a number of other useful datasets:

* `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
* `planes`: construction information about each plane
* `airports`: airport names and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names
